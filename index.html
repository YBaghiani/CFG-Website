  <h1>Fancy changing someone's life for the better, over a cuppa?</h1>

  <h2>About us</h2>

  <p>Very often, we tend to forget the human aspect of the refugee crisis. When we're so inundated with facts and figures, the effect of displacement can become an afterthought. These people have fled conflict, war and persecution and escaped with their own lives, but often find themselves alone. Isolated in countries and cultures they're not familiar with, surrounded by new languages that many struggle to speak.<br /><br />
    By nature, we're social beings. We share, we tell stories, and we need a sense of belonging. Above all, we have a fundamental need to feel valued by others, and part of this involves listening, and being listened to. All over the world, since the dawn of humanity, we've used food and hot drinks as a way of sharing, bonding and bridging gaps — and whether we prefer masala chai, mint tea or a classic builder's brew, we all get the same thing out of it.<br /><br />
    And as a nation of tea-drinkers, we can help those in need by doing what we do best — sharing a cuppa. We partner up with local councils to hold events in local coffee shops, cafés and community spaces around London where you can meet and bond with London's refugees. We serve a selection of teas and other hot drinks, leave the rest to our guests, and hope that these events will spark bonds that lead to meet-ups you arrange amongst yourselves.
