http://stories.unhcr.org/ahmets-story-cyprus-p52234.html

“I will think about my options, but I’m certainly not going at sea again. I left for the future of my kids; I’m not going to die with them in the sea. Life is not over.”

  <h2> Sam's Story</h2>
  <img src=images/14.jpg>
http://stories.unhcr.org/sams-story-greece-p4882.html

“For me, one of the greatest challenges facing society, the government, and organizations like UNHCR, is combating hate. I wish that all could understand this: we are forced to flee our homes, we’re not coming here to cause trouble. I wish they could understand we’re all human beings, living under the same sky.”

http://stories.unhcr.org/nastthos-story-ethiopia-p970.html

“I would like to be a doctor as I think this is the best way to help my people. I hope and want all Somali girls and women to learn and study and go onto university. Maybe if we are all educated we can change the future of our country.”

  <h2> Naima's Story</h2>
  <img src=images/16.jpg>
http://stories.unhcr.org/naima-abdullahi-p134.html

“I think because of being a refugee I understand life in a completely different way. I still remember where we were, where I started, the house I lived. Today on this end I have everything at my fingertips. I have opportunities, especially as a woman, which I wouldn’t have had. I can make things happen for myself, whether I make it or not is all up to me.”
